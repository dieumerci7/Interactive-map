    This map shows the percentages of residents of each oblast categorized by ethnicity and
    native languages on the territory of todayâ€™s Ukraine according to the results of the 1959
    Soviet census.<br>

    Before 1991, the Ukrainian SSR consisted of 25 oblasts and two cities of republican
    subordination, Kyiv and Sevastopol.<br>

    In 1954, the new Cherkasy oblast was created out of the southern raions of Kyiv oblast, and
    some raions of Poltava and Kirovohrad oblasts. Same year, Izmail oblast was merged into
    Odesa oblast; and Crimean oblast was transferred from the Rusian RSFSR to Ukrainian SSR.<br>

    In 1958, Voroshylovhrad oblast was renamed Luhansk. And in 1959, Drohobych oblast
    merged with Lviv oblast.<br>
